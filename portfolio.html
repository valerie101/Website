<h1>A little bit About Me</h1>
<p><h3>
My name is Raven Jo-Lee, and I am a college student and I'm majoring in Art and Digital Desgin,
and minoring in Web-Desgin. I was born on December 1st 1998. I have four other siblings , 
two who are twins a girl and a boy, and they are attending college like me and are juniors
and a younger brother and sister who are attending middle school.
I enjoy drawing because it gives me satisfaction of bringing my ideas to life
and because it comes naturaly to me and I wish to develop it into something more!
I can’t speak for others but this is why I like drawing and creating original art from my imagination. Its not just about making marks on a piece of paper for me.
I often create art to have the opportunity to speak in a non-verbal language - in a way that just isn’t possible through any other means. Creating art can be a cathartic process, 
through using this internal dialogue that drawing allows us. 
Drawing and creating original art helps me to understand my world.
